    "Before we jump into the code, lets take a bit of time to talk about the \"tensor\" in Tensorflow, so you'll have a better understanding of whats going on under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensors, ranks and dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you looked at the three words above this and were confused...Well, join the club! Mathematically, the concept of tensors has everything to with the amount of columns (or variables) you have and how its organized. To really get started on this, let's describe our tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensor Types\n",
    "You've seen actually seen and worked with tensors before here at Make School. Don't beleive me? I'll show you!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scalar\n",
    "Scalars are data that are fully described by numerical value alone.\n",
    "Think of an int type (or Number in Javascript). It is simple a value that describes a single quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Programatically scalars would look like this:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#python\n",
    "var_count = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "#javascript\n",
    "let varCount = 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#Swift\n",
    "let varCount: Int = 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*USE IN DATA SCIENCE:*\n",
    "In your dataset, this would be a value of one column of a singlar\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that there is *no other form of measurement for this datatype* meaning that the datatype cant be indexed....Speaking of indexable datatypes...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vectors\n",
    "Vectors are data that are fully described by a list of numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just skowled at this page becuase the word vector reminded you of Vector Calculus and all those wild symbols, you're not alone. \n",
    "Think of vectors as a container for scalars. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Programatically vectors would look like this:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#python\n",
    "list_of_counts = [1,2,3,5,6,7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "#javascript\n",
    "let arrayOfCounts = [1,2,3,5,6,7];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#Swift\n",
    "let arrayOfCounts = [1,2,3,5,6,7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*USE IN DATA SCIENCE:*\n",
    "In your dataset, this would be a single row of a dataset that would be composed just of numerical values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tensors and dimensions\n",
    "Tensors have the same relationship to vectors in terms of magnitude as vectors have to scalars. That is, it has a higher number of dimensions that values exist in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking programatically instead of mathematically:\n",
    "    - a scalar cant be indexed, since itself *IS* a measurement\n",
    "        - think of how when you call a variable of this type, it just returns its value\n",
    "    - A vector can be indexed by position but only with one index"
